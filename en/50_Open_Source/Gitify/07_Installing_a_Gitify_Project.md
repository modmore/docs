When you built a site with Gitify, and committed the data to a repository, you will at some point need to use the data to set up a copy of that site. This tutorial outlines that process.

## Prerequisites
To install a gitify project you first have to install Gitify:

* [Install Gitify](Installation)

After it has been installed globally we can start installing the project:
## Cloning and Configuring
First we clone the repository inside a new project folder:

    git clone REPOSITORY-LINK PROJECT-NAME

Once your project has been cloned go into that projects directory. 
Now open `.gitify` and configure it to your liking. If you are using a custom repository like the one from ModMore you should edit the repository details to authenticate to that repository.

## Installing MODX
Now we are ready to tell gitify to install the latest MODX and all needed packages:

    Gitify modx:install
After you've used this command Gitify will ask you some questions, if you didn't create a database yet you can put in the details of a MySQL user who has the rights to create databases.

The result should look like this:

    Downloading MODX from http://modx.com/download/latest/...
    ################################################ 100.0%
    Extracting zip...
    Moving unzipped files out of temporary directory...
    Please complete following details to install MODX. Leave empty to use the [default].
    Database Name [gitify_test]: 
    Database User [root]: root
    Database Password: 
    Hostname [robin]: localhost
    Base URL [/]: /gitify_test/
    Manager Language [en]: 
    Manager User [gitify_test_admin]: admin
    Database Password [generated]: 
    Manager Email: gitify@gmail.com
    Running MODX Setup...
    Done! Time: 133,557ms | Memory Usage: 2.25 mb | Peak Memory Usage: 2.31 mb

## Installing the packages

MODX has now been freshly installed and is now ready to have extras installed. But installing them one by one is going to be a hassle so we're just gonna execute this command:

    Gitify package:install --all

This command installs all the packages defined in `.gitify`, the result should look something like this:

    Searching Provider for Ace...
    Downloading Ace (1.5.0)...
    Installing Ace...
    Package Ace installed
    
    Searching Provider for BigBrother...
    Downloading Big Brother (1.1.0)...
    Installing BigBrother...
    Package BigBrother installed
    
    Etc.    

## Building the project
After all the packages are installed we are ready to complete the project installation with this command:

    Gitify build --force

The result should look something like this, don't worry if it generates some errors about MySQL queries it should still work.

    Building modContext from contexts/...
    Building modContextSetting from context_settings/...
    Building content from content/...
    Forcing build, removing prior Resources...

    Building modCategory from categories/...
    Building modTemplate from templates/...
    Building modTemplateVar from template_variables/...
    Building modTemplateVarTemplate from template_variables_access/...
	.....
    Clearing cache...
    Done! Time: 9,603ms | Memory Usage: 15.65 mb | Peak Memory Usage: 17.97 mb

Your project has now been installed!

## Permissions
If you are on a *nix machine and got issues with pages staying white it probably has to do with permissions. To fix this, please use these commands in the root of your project:

    chmod 777 assets
    chmod 777 -R assets/components core/cache core/components core/packages
If it gives you permission denied errors try to use `sudo` in front of every command.
