ClientConfig has a few settings that allow you to change its behaviour. These are available under System > System Settings in the clientconfig namespace.

## Admin Groups (`clientconfig.admin_groups`)

A comma separated list of user groups that are authorized to access the admin area of ClientConfig where the groups and fields can be set up.

## Clear Cache (`clientconfig.clear_cache`)

When enabled, the MODX Resource cache will be cleared whenever a change is made to the values in ClientConfig. 
 
## Vertical Tabs (`clientconfig.vertical_tabs`)

Enable to use a TV-like vertical tab system instead of horizontal tabs for the groups. 

## Google Fonts API Key (`clientconfig.google_fonts_api_key`)

When using the Google Font List field type, you'll need to set up an API Key to use here.
