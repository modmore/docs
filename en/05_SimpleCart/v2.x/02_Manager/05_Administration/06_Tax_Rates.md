Tax rates are the percentages of tax that are applied to an order. With the [Tax Sets and Rules](Tax_Sets_Rules) you can determine when the tax rate is applied if you have multiple different rates.

## Creating a new Tax rate

Hit the _Create new Tax rate_ button to add a tax rate. Choose the shop context, add a name, the tax percentage, and a description. The rank, not shown in the screenshot below, allows you to set a priority on the tax rates. The higher the rank, the more priority it has over other tax rates.
