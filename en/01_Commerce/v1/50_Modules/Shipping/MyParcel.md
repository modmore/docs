## Installation

The MyParcel integration is available [as an official extension](https://modmore.com/commerce/extensions/myparcel/). To offer support and continued maintenance, we charge a one-time license fee for it. It's free to use on development.

## Configuration

Visit [this page](https://modmore.com/commerce/extensions/myparcel/) for setup instructions.

## Checkout

To show the currently selected date/time in the checkout, use something like this in your templates:

```html
{% if shipment.properties.delivery_date %}
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: normal; text-transform: uppercase; font-size: 0.8em">
        {{ shipment.properties.delivery_date }},
        {{ shipment.properties.delivery_from|slice(0,5) }}&ndash;{{ shipment.properties.delivery_until|slice(0,5) }}
    </span>
{% endif %}
```

You can also check `shipment.properties.delivery_type` to see if it is a delivery (values 1-3) or pickup (values 4 or 5).
