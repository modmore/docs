title: Auto Products (formerly Free Products)
---

The Auto Products module lets you add products to the cart automatically, when certain conditions are met. Once enabled, it becomes available from the Discounts tabs.

_This module was formerly called the Free Products module, however as of Commerce v1.10 it is called Auto Products as it can now also add products that are not free._
