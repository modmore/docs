## Minor logic changes in add to cart process

A new event has been added in v1.10 that allows cancelling an item being added to the cart, `\Commerce::EVENT_ITEM_BEFORE_ADD_TO_CART`.

To accommodate this new event, it's good to know the `\Commerce::EVENT_ITEM_ADDED_TO_CART` event **no longer fires if adding was cancelled** (for example, in the EnforceStock module or custom logic).

When programmatically using `\Commerce\Frontend\Steps\Cart::createOrderItem()` to create cart items, that also no longer runs the `\Commerce::EVENT_ITEM_ADDED_TO_CART` event - that has been moved into the `addProductToCart` method.

## Rename FreeProducts module to AutoProducts

As you can now also use the FreeProducts module to add products with a price to an order, we renamed it to AutoProducts. Users will not be able to remove such products, making it useful for things like mandatory charges.

In rare cases where this module was extended this may cause a backwards compatibility break, however we don't recommend doing that to begin with.
