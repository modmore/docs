## Custom Basic Fields now unsets fields when provided an empty value string

Previously the module only executed when providing a non-empty value. Now, if you provide an empty string, it will unset the value previously persisted.

In rare cases where you may repeat the field on multiple steps in the checkout (without pre-filling it from the current value), this can cause information to get lost, so we recommend double-checking your configuration.

## TaxJar full order calculation

Previously, the TaxJar tax calculation operated on a per-line basis. This could lead to incorrect tax results, especially when shipping was taxed depending on the contents of the order.

As of 1.6, the full order is calculated at once, so tax calculations may be different moving forward.

While the full order is sent to TaxJar at once, the individual tax rules on different tax groups still apply.

The product category selection is now also moved from the Tax Rule to individual Products to allow submitting the order at once.

## HMRC VAT Validation updated

We've updated the EUVATValidator module for UK VAT numbers to the v2 API as required by the HMRC. This uses a small proxy service to save you the need to apply for production credentials for each individual site.
