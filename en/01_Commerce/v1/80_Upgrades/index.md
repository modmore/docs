As Commerce evolves, occasionally upgrading will require some manual effort. Some features may only be avaiable if you enable them, or templating changes are necessary in your custom templates.

This section of the documentation contains a list of each minor release, and the things to note when updating **to** that release. We recommend always checking the upgrade documentation **before upgrading**.

> We start keeping track of changes during development, so you'll usually see an upgrade document for a version that is not yet available.

We generally support the last two minor releases. After enough time has passed (~ a year), the 2nd last version will only receive security fixes as needed.
