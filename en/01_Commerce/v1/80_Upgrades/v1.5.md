## Status changes for Authorized vs Paid orders

You can now define different status changes to run depending on the type of payment that was completed in the checkout. This makes it possible to mark orders as "awaiting payment" if a manual payment method was chosen that needs to be manually verified for example.

## pending-transaction.twig template changes

We improved the pending-transaction.twig template to make it more user-friendly when users find themselves in the checkout with a pending transaction. If you have a custom template, we recommend reviewing it and see if you should incorporate our changes.

## Optional iDeal 2 support

Update your iDeal payment method (using Mollie) to `ideal2` to start using iDEAL 2 per July 1st 2024.. This will hide the issuers from your checkout as required for iDEAL 2.
