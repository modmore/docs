description: Legacy documentation for Redactor for MODX v1.

---

Redactor 1.x was our original implementation of Redactor. In September 2015 we released [Redactor 2.0](https://www.modmore.com/blog/2015/announcing-redactor-2.0/) as a free upgrade. Redactor 1 is no longer officially supported following the release of Redactor 2. [The latest Redactor documentation can be found here](../../Redactor). 

The Redactor 1.x documentation is archived in this section. [Check our notes when upgrading from Redactor 1.x to 2.0](../v2.x/Upgrading_from_Redactor_1.x_to_2.0)
