[BabelTranslate](https://modmore.com/babeltranslate/) simple but very useful MODX extra if you want to have your content automatically translated with a translation service (currently it supports DeepL API Free and Pro).

It translates the content of a MODX resource with a button from a linked Babel resource. The translatable resource fields must be defined beforehand with a comma-separated list. The translatable template variables and the translatable ContentBlocks fields must be configured beforehand with a JSON.

The volume of DeepL API Free translation is 500,000 characters per month, which is enough for 10-100 pages (depends a lot on the length of the content).

It is a perfect solution for users who want a well-translated content in different languages.
