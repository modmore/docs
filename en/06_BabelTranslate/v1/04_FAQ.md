## What are the additional cost for the DeepL API?

If you translate only 500.000 characters per month with BabelTranslate, you can
use the [DeepL API Free](https://www.deepl.com/en/pro/change-plan#developer).
Otherwise, you need to use the DeepL API Pro, the cost of which is flexible
based on the translated characters.
