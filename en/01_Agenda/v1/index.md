[Agenda](https://modmore.com/agenda/) is a feature rich MODX calendar extra. It comes with a lot of options like the ability to create and edit repeating events, assign categories and a MODX resource to an event. The location of an event can be displayed with Google Maps. It also supports importing an external iCalendar/XML feed into one calendar, which can be updated with a cronjob. Events can be assigned to a MODX user, usergroup or context.

It is a perfect solution for users looking for an extensive MODX event management calendar or just a well-supported MODX calendar component.
