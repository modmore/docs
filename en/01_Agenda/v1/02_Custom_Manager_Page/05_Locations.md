This tab contains a paginated grid with all locations.

![Tab Locations](img/locations.png)

You can create a new location with a click on the create location button on the top
left above the locations grid.

The grid can be filtered by a search input on the top right above the
locations grid.

Each location can be edited by a click on the edit icon in the row of the
location. And it can be deleted after a confirmation with a click on the trash
icon in the row of the location.

The row of each location shows the name, the formatted address, the active state
and the show on map setting (if you have set the Google Maps API key in the
system settings) of an entry. The name and the address can be edited inline
with a double click on the text.

## Create/Edit

The create/edit window for one location has some options, that can be set.

### Location Tab

On the location tab you can set the location name, toggle it to inactive (and
toggle the display on a map, if you have set the Google Maps API key in the
system settings).

Fields](../06_Extended_Fields.md) system setting.

### Address Tab

On the address tab you can enter the address. If you have set the Google Maps
API key in the system settings, you can geocode that address with the search
button on the map. If marker on the map is not set right, you can drag it
around (the location latitude and longitude values will be changed). Also, the
map content can be dragged with the mouse (the map latitude and longitude
values will be changed). The zoom level of the map can be changed by clicking
on the plus/minus signs (the zoom value will be changed).
