This tab contains a paginated grid with all modules installed in Agenda.

![Tab Modules](img/modules.png)

It is visible only to a user who has enabled the `agenda_modules` permission. A
module can be added by entering a package name in lowercase. An installed module
can be activated, deactivated and removed with one click in the context menu of
the module row. The `active` column ‘Active’ can be edited inline and the trash
icon can remove a module. At least the modules can be sorted by drag & drop.

The creation of custom modules will be described later. Until then, we will
send the code of a skeleton module on demand.
