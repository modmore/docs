This tab contains a paginated grid with all categories.

You can create a new category with a click on the create category button on the top
left above the categories grid.

The grid can be filtered by a search input on the top right above the
categories grid.

Each category can be edited by a click on the edit icon in the row of the
category. And it can be deleted after a confirmation with a click on the trash
icon in the row of the category.

The row of each category shows the color icon, the name, the alias and the
active state of an entry. The name and the alias can be edited inline with
a double click on the text.

## Create/Edit

The create/edit window for one category has some options, that can be set.

You can set the category name, the category alias, and you can toggle it to
inactive. And you can set the category text and background color with a color
picker.

The category can be linked with a MODX resource. This combo field is only
shown, when the system setting `agenda.parents_category` is filled with a comma
separated list of resources, that are parents for the resources selectable with
the combo field. This combo has a select, a preview and a quickedit button. The
resource can be edited in a new window with an alt click on the quickedit
button.
