This hook saves FormIt fields as an Agenda event. The hook was introduced with Agenda 1.1.0.

It can update an existing event, if an event ID or a repeating ID is set. This
can be done by FormIt hook properties or by request parameters. The FormIt
hook properties supercede the request parameters.

If no event_id or repeating_id is set, a new event is created.
