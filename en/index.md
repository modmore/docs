# Welcome to the modmore documentation

If you're looking for information on using our [Extras for MODX](https://modmore.com/extras/), look no further! All documentation for extras developed or distributed by modmore can be found on this site.

## Get help

If you can't find the answer to your question in the documentation, it's worth checking the [frequently asked questions](https://support.modmore.com). The most common questions are collected there, often linking back to detailed documentation here.

To get in touch, email support@modmore.com or [post on our community forum](https://forum.modmore.com/). We're here to help!

## Available extras & support

Depending on the extra, different levels of support are available.

- For **open source extras**, [post on our forum](https://forum.modmore.com/c/open-source/12) or the [MODX community forum](https://community.modx.com/) to get help. Or if you need help quickly, get paid [Premium Support](https://modmore.com/premium-modx-support/).
- For **premium extras**, email support is included with your license, and is provided by modmore or Treehill Studio. If you email [support@modmore.com](mailto:support@modmore.com) it'll land in the right inbox, and you'll get a response within 24 hours (business days).

For third party extras (other than those by Treehill Studio), we offer paid [Premium Support](https://modmore.com/premium-modx-support/).

Here's a summary of the extras currently available from modmore and their support options/information links:

Additionally, documentation is available for several extras by Sterc. These extras were offered as premium before, but were open sourced as the provided support level was insufficient. These extras are no longer available from modmore, but we've kept the documentation around as they are currently the only copy.

- [DigitalSignage](DigitalSignage)
- [Formalicious](Formalicious)

> **These extras are not covered by modmore's standard support.** If you need help with them, we offer paid [Premium Support](https://modmore.com/premium-modx-support/) or you may reach out to Sterc directly/on GitHub.

## Browse the documentation offline

It's possible to [download a full archive of this website](modmore-documentation.zip) (around 25MB) to browse it offline. After downloading, unpack the zip file into a memorable place.

You'll get the best results when serving the files on a local web server (apache/nginx). This will allow you to use the entire documentation site exactly like it works on [docs.modmore.com](https://docs.modmore.com/), including a functional search.

> Not all images are included in the download. If you're actually offline you might not see all screenshots.

## Improve the documentation

If you're already comfortable with our extras (or you just spotted a typo!), you can help us improving this documentation through [GitHub](https://github.com/modmore/docs). [Read more about contributing to the Documentation](Meta/Contributing_to_Docs).
