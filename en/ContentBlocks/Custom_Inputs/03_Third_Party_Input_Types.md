## oEmbed Input

Developed by us here at modmore, the oEmbed Input can be installed via the [modmore.com package provider](https://www.modmore.com/about/package-provider/) as a free package. It was first released on April 26th 2014.

The oEmbed Input Type allows you to embed content from a few dozen oEmbed-enabled content providers, by simply pasting in the link to the content. By making use of the [noembed.com](http://noembed.com/) web service, you have instant embed-ability for close to 50 content providers, varying from YouTube, Vimeo and Spotify, to Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox, Amazon and many more.

The oEmbed Input is licensed as MIT and available on [Github](https://github.com/modmore/ContentBlocks_oEmbed).
