This tab contains a paginated grid with all [settings](../04_System_Settings.md) of the consentfriend
namespace.

[![](img/settings.png)](img/settings.png)

It is only visible for a user that has the `setting` or the
`consentfriend_setting` permission enabled. Each setting can be edited the
same as in the MODX system settings panel.
