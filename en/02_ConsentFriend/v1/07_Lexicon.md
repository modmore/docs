title: Lexicon

If you want to change the text and the buttons in the consent management window,
you have to use the MODX lexicon system.

Navigate in the manager to System (gear icon) > Lexicons. In the lexicon
management grid you have to select `consentfriend` as namespace, `web` as area
and the language, you want to change the entry.

Double click on the value of any of the strings to edit them and **clear the
MODX cache** for changes to appear in the front-end.

The changes made this way will also persist across updates of the ConsentFriend
package.

The ConsentFriend lexicon can be translated on
[Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/treehillstudio/consentfriend/).
