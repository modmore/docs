To disable the automatic loading and execution of the YouTube videos, you have
to modify i.e. the iframe code with the following code:

```
<iframe type="text/plain" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M7lc1UVf-VE" data-name="youtube" ...>
```

Since ConsentFriend 1.2.0 the embedded YouTube videos are hidden and a
placeholder with a consent button inside is displayed.
