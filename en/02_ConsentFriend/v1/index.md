[ConsentFriend](https://modmore.com/consentfriend/) is a simple but powerful
consent management platform for MODX. It acts as a privacy and security tool,
that controls the usage of third-party services on your website to protect the
frontend users.

ConsentFriend disables third-party services and displays a consent management
window on the website. With this consent management window, the website user
can accept various third-party services. Afterwards the accepted services are
enabled on the page without a reload of the page. That way ConsentFriend
prepares a compliance with GDPR/DSGVO on the website and helps the site admin to
setup the consent management in an easy way.

It is a perfect solution for website operators, that have to use third-party
frontend services on a MODX website. Since those services are able to collect
personal data, the service usage has to be fully transparent and compliant.
