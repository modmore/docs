## How could I transform an exisiting Google Analytics implementation in a MODX site to ConsentFriend?  

1. Locate the usage of Google Analytics in your template or in the dependent
chunk calls.
2. Copy the Google Analytics ID (a string starting with `UA-`) in
the template or chunk and create a system setting `google_analytics_id`
with that value.
3. Disable that chunk (i.e. by renaming it) or the template
part (i.e. by surrounding it with `[[-` and `]]`).
4. Enable ConsentFriend in the frontend.
5. Clear the MODX cache.

## Can I use different Google Analytics IDs in different contexts?

Thats possible. The default Google Analytics service uses the MODX
system/context setting tag `[[++google_analytics_id]]`. So you have to create a
context setting `google_analytics_id` with the value of the Google Analytics ID.

## The consent modal displays only lexicon keys instead of translated strings

Thats a result of different language detection. MODX uses the cultureKey
system/context setting and ConsentFriend uses the html lang attribute. So you
have to fill the html lang attribute with the cultureKey system/context setting:
`<html lang="[[++cultureKey]]">`.

## I would like to change the texts of ConsentFriend

This could be done with the ConsentFriend [lexicon](06_Lexicon.md).

## How could I create an own theme for ConsentFriend?

If you want to create your own theme, you could import the file
`assets/components/consentfriend/scss/klaro.scss` in your scss workflow. There
are a few scss variables available in
`assets/components/consentfriend/scss/vars.scss` that could be overridden
before. To disable the default styling of the modal afterwards, please set the
system setting consentfriend.js_url to
`/assets/components/consentfriend/js/web/consentfriend-no-css.js`.
